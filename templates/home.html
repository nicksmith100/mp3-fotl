            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Folk on the Lawn (FotL) is a volunteer-run festival which runs every 
                year at the Abbey Mill, Tintern.</p>
            <p>With no budget whatsoever, FotL relies on the good will of those 
                involved - the artists, sound technicians, Abbey Mill staff, the good 
                folk of Tintern and various other benefactors and supporters.
            <p>Despite its modest size, FotL has featured a number of international 
                artists and signed bands, in addition to the more local talent that 
                has graced its stages. Folks continue to commit to FotL due to the 
                beauty of the setting, the atmosphere of the event (very relaxed!) 
                and the magnanimous hosting of the Abbey Mill management and staff.</p>
            <p>We encourage rootsy, homespun, innovative and brave music, with a strong 
                folk/roots/acoustic thread running through the whole festival. We would 
                see the festival as the antithesis of and remedy for the X Factor, 
                'tired folk' sort-of-thing.</p>

            <p>The Abbey Mill is located in the centre of Tintern on the A466 and is easily accessible from the M4, M48, M5 and M50 motorways. Tintern is only 6 miles from junction 2 of the M48.</p>
            <p>Parking at Abbey Mill is extremely limited, and we ask that the main car park is reserved for equipment drop-off and pick-up, and for blue badge holders and less mobile visitors. (There is one designated disabled parking space.) The nearest public car park is the Lower Wireworks car park, which is free and can be accessed by taking the minor road alongside the Wild Hare (the old Royal George Hotel). There is also quite a bit of on-road parking nearby, as well as car parks at the village hall, The Anchor and Tintern Abbey (parking charges may apply).</p>
