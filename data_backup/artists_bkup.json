Her music encapsulates what we\u2019re all about and has enamoured many who have been fortunate to catch her performances. After a good few years away from us, she returns this year.\r\n\r\nAnna started playing the piano at age 5 and the harp at age 11. Her earliest \u2013 and possibly seminal \u2013  musical experiences, however, involved playing the organ in a Welsh Baptist chapel. \r\n\r\nAs Anna studied the piano, she listened to performances of Debussy and Chopin. These influences continue to be relevant (and expanding: with opera taking on a meaning for her) but a whole load of more contemporary interests have been added to them, possibly within the folk/psych folk/avant-garde folk sphere: Yann Tiersen, guitarist Melanie Page (who has appeared twice at FotL), Trembling Bells and Joanna Newsom, with works by Kate Bush, Bjork and Nick Drake having significance also with regard to her writing.\r\n\r\nAnna sings in both English and Welsh. She has written, \u2018I feel the need to sing in Welsh as it brings me close to my Welsh roots. I love languages. Especially when I lived away from Wales in the Midlands, the Welsh folk songs made me feel at home\u2026as did the harp\u2019.

Gareth takes inspiration from nature, old folk themes and spirituality, and interweaves these with poetry of life experiences.\r\n\r\nHe has been playing live as a solo act for approximately 10 years, in south Wales and also further afield in the UK.\r\n\r\nLast year was his first at Folk on the Lawn. Those who witnessed his sets would have been struck by the immense skill and versatility of his guitar work \u2013 airy and yet precise \u2013 together with a delicately understated vocal delivery: little songs of great delight.\r\n\r\nGareth has recorded six self-produced albums to date. Three are available at the link below, including Time and Tide, his most recent record and one we\u2019d heartily recommend.", "artist_url": "http://www.garethdavies.bandcamp.com/", "artist_img": "xtm2cmf4xdbwq4wnrolg", "show1_stage": "Cottage", "show1_start": {"$date": "2023-07-14T17:00:00Z"}, "show1_duration": "45", "show2_stage": "Mill", "show2_start": {"$date": "2023-07-15T14:00:00Z"}, "show2_duration": "45", "show3_stage": "", "show3_start": {"$date": {"$numberLong": "-2208988800000"}}, "show3_duration": "", "last_edit_by": "nicksmith", "last_edit_on": "15-11-2023"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "65554548010f0c0d36f663e0"}, "artist_name": "The Iambic Assassin", "artist_bio": "The Iambic Assassin (Mark Jefferis) is a poet, who prefers to refer to himself as a promoter of silly verse.

For many years Mark has penned poems for friends and special family occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Iambic Assassin has not confined himself to the spoken/written word alone, however. A fine singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist, he has produced some excellent aural work, both solo and with various collaborators.\r\n\r\nHis performances last year were relaxed and yet compelling.
